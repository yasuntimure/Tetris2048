# Tetris2048

We hace combined together well-known two games Tetris and 2048. To implement the project, We have used StdDraw library of Java and our knowledge of OOP. We have developed a “Tetris 2048” with implementing the functionality of Tetris with 2 shapes (T and O) and implemented fully the 2048 with score updates, merging and deleting squares up to 2048.

This project aims to develop a game in Java with the use of “StdDraw” library. The game is formed of two games combined together which are Tetris and 2048. Thus, in this game I expect to bring the logic of merging numbers of 2048 and grid row clearing of Tetris when a row is filled completely with the shapes.
